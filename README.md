### ‚ú® Featured Projects

Here are a couple of projects that showcase my capabilities in applied AI:

#### 1. AI-Powered Chatbot for FinSolve Technologies

* **Description:** A sophisticated GenAI chatbot developed for a fictional FinTech company, FinSolve Technologies, designed to centralize internal communication, break down data silos, and provide secure, role-based access to information.
* **Key Features:**
    * **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Ensures data visibility is tailored to user departments (Finance, HR, etc.).
    * **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Implements real-time semantic retrieval of department-specific documentation, leveraging vector embeddings for context.
    * **Natural Language Processing:** Allows users to interact using plain English queries.
* **Architecture:** Utilizes **FastAPI** for the backend, **Streamlit** for the frontend, **Gemini 2.0** as the LLM for response generation, **Nomic Embeddings** for vector creation, and **ChromaDB** via **LangChain** for vector search.
* **Impact:** Significantly improves cross-departmental collaboration by providing accurate and relevant information securely and on-demand.

#### 2. AI Video Summarizer & Highlight Generator

* **Description:** An AI-powered tool designed to condense lengthy video content (webinars, lectures, meetings) into concise summaries and intelligent highlight points. This project is aimed at enhancing content consumption efficiency.
* **Process & Technologies:**
    * **Audio Extraction & Normalization:** Uses **MoviePy** to extract audio and **SoundFile** to normalize it to 16000Hz.
    * **Audio-to-Text Transcription:** Leverages **OpenAI Whisper** from Hugging Face for highly accurate transcription of the audio.
    * **Visual Content Analysis:** Employs **BLIP-2** to understand visual context and **EasyOCR** to read on-screen text.
    * **Summary & Highlight Generation:** Both the transcribed audio text and visually analyzed information are fed into the **Gemini model** to generate comprehensive summaries and key highlight points.
* **Impact:** Saves significant time for users by providing quick insights into long-form video content, making information more accessible and actionable.
